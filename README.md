# Task-3-Dashboard-Design

# Interactive Sales & Profitability Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the "Superstore Sales" dataset to uncover key business insights. The primary deliverable is an interactive dashboard built with Tableau, designed to help business stakeholders understand sales performance, identify profitability drivers, and explore regional trends. This repository contains the source dataset and a summary presentation of the findings.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of business health by tracking critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and allowing for dynamic, data-driven exploration.

## Dashboard Features

The interactive dashboard includes the following components:

* **KPI Summary Cards:** At-a-glance metrics for Total Sales, Total Profit, and overall Profit Ratio.
* **Time-Series Analysis:** A line chart visualizing sales trends over time to identify seasonality and growth patterns.
* **Category Performance Analysis:** A detailed bar chart breaking down sales and profit by product category and sub-category to pinpoint top-performing and underperforming products.
* **Geographic Profitability Map:** A color-coded map of the United States that visualizes profit by state, highlighting strong and weak regions.
* **Interactive Filters:** Users can dynamically filter the entire dashboard by product category and region, enabling deep-dive analysis and personalized views.
